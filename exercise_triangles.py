"""Write a program that reads the lengths of the two sides of a right triangle and calculates the length of the third side. Hint: if the first side is a and the second side is b, the third side c is the square root of (a x a) + (b x b).

Note: I did not teach you how to calculate a square root in Python.. Try to search for that yourself!

Example output:

First side: 3
Second side: 4

The length of the third side of this triangle is 5.0"""



#Function for calculations sides of triangle
